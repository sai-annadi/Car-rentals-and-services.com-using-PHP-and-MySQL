<p>The current recommendation for a full car service is once every 12 months or every 12,000 miles. 
   So, what does an annual car service include? A full service adds about 15 to 30 different automotive 
   checks on top of what you get from an interim car service. These can include checking the coolant system, 
   throttle operation, distributor cap condition, and mounts for the gearbox and the engine. It can also include 
   the condition of the wheels, the wheel bearings, and the starter motor.The assessments are more extensive in 
   a full car service. The garage can also check for additional items based on the guidelines and recommendations 
   of the vehicle manufacturer. Do take note that there is an extra charge for any additional work to be done on your car.
   The price of this service based on the car model and car repairing working.
