<p>This is one of the most basic car services that shops can provide. It is also one 
   of the cheapest. All types of car servicing also include a change of the motor oil 
   and filter. This service helps make sure that your carâ€™s engine gets all the proper 
   lubrication. It ensures a more efficient engine operation. The only problem with this 
   type of service is that the garage personnel will only focus on the engine of the car.
   Motor oil, engine oil, or engine lubricant is any one of various substances that consist 
   of base oils enhanced with various additives, particularly antiwear additives, detergents, 
   dispersants, and, for multi-grade oils, viscosity index improvers. Motor oil is used for 
   lubrication of internal combustion engines. The main function of motor oil is to reduce 
   friction and wear on moving parts and to clean the engine from sludge (one of the functions of 
   dispersants) and varnish (detergents). It also neutralizes acids that originate from fuel and from 
   oxidation of the lubricant (detergents), improves sealing of piston rings, and cools the engine by 
   carrying heat away from moving parts.In addition to the aforementioned basic constituents, almost 
   all lubricating oils contain corrosion and oxidation inhibitors. Motor oil may be composed of only 
   a lubricant base stock in the case of non-detergent oil, or a lubricant base stock plus additives to 
   improve the oil's detergency, extreme pressure performance, and ability to inhibit corrosion of engine 
   parts.Motor oils are blended using base oils composed of petroleum-based hydrocarbons, polyalphaolefins 
   (PAO), or their mixtures in various proportions, sometimes with up to 20% by weight of esters for better 
   dissolution of additives.This price of this service depend on both the car model and oil company.
