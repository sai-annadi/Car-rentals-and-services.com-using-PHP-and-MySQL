Utilizing XAMPP to host the PHP and MySQL server locally, users can set up and deploy the system on their own machines or local servers for convenient access.

In conclusion, the Cars Rental and Services system is a powerful tool that empowers car rental businesses with efficient management capabilities. With features like user management, car management, reservation system, detailed service records, and secure login functionality, the system offers a seamless and organized approach to managing car rentals and services.
